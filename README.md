# ACO Path Planning in MATLAB
# This repository contains MATLAB code for an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based robot path planning algorithm. The code uses a grid map, where obstacles are marked by 1 and free spaces by 0, and finds a path from a start node to a target node.

# Files
# main.m: Main function that implements the ACO algorithm and plots the results.
# G2D.m: Helper function that converts the grid map into an adjacency (distance) matrix.

# Usage
# Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository folder.
# Run the main function: main.

# The algorithm will run, and figures showing the convergence curve and robot trajectory will be displayed.
